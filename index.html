                    <p class="card-text">"With Eston's laser-focused guidance I gained approximately seven (7) pounds
                        of muscle in a month-and-a-half. In that same time period I also LOST one (1) pound of fat! My
                        total weight change was approximately six (6) pounds starting from one hundred and fifty (150)
                        pounds and ending at one hundred and fifty six (156) pounds."

                <p class="card-text">"I suspect the majority of folks considering whether to undertake personal
                    training
                    with Eston
                    may not, at first glance, be able to relate to the progress I made under his wing; the reason
                    being that from the outset my goal was, and still is, to GAIN weight as opposed to LOSE it.
                    With Eston's help I was able to completely annihilate my wildest expectations; at best I felt,
                    in the time given, that I'd gain a max of two (2) pounds, maybe three (3), but Eston positively
                    demolished that expectation, as shown above. Now, for the sake of transparency, my goal was to
                    hit one hundred and sixty (160) pounds and I did not achieve that. However, I was informed
                    early on that a realistic time frame to put on all ten (10) pounds would be three (3) to four
                    (4) months; which is to say, I made more than half the progress I was hoping to achieve in less
                    than half the time I was told it typically takes--this is what Eston brings to the table."</p>

                    <p class="card-text">"As solid of a coach as Eston is, there's one huge caveat: you have to listen!
                        As great as things went when he was right there next to me, obviously he didn't follow me home
                        and such;
                        you will be told how to make the changes you seek in your life and YOU have to be the one to
                        take action. For me this primarily involved altering my eating habits in order to facilitate
                        muscle growth; I suspect that too will be a hurdle for you. I listened very, very carefully to
                        what he said, hanging on every word, and still I misstepped; there were two times in particular
                        where I didn't heed his advice regarding eating appropriately before working out: one time I
                        nearly passed out while the other ended with me throwing up. Moral of the story: he knows what
                        he's talking about!"</p>

                    <p>"I went to 24 hoping to put on weight before I went back to teaching as
                        I rarely find time to workout during the school year. Eston absolutely helped me capitalize on
                        the time I had, and I was so pleased with how our first series of sessions went that I elected
                        to add on more BECAUSE I trusted that even with just a couple more weeks Eston could work me
                        that much closer to my goal."</p>

                    <p>As of this writing I believe I've accumulated twenty (20) or so sessions with Eston; this value
                        isn't counting the "introduction" sessions that are mandated by 24--with those the value climbs
                        to about twenty-five (25). From the first session to the last Eston felt like "my" coach. He
                        was approachable, motivating, and ultra knowledgeable. We tended to run tight on time because
                        he made it a point to answer all of my questions as thoroughly as possible."</p>
